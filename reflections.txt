In this mockup article I learned how to use 2 new tags: 
1. Strikethrough - <strike></strike> Draws a line through the words which are in between the tags. 
2. Superscript - <sup></sup> Draws a superscript (an exponent in math)

I had written some html a few years ago so a lot of the tags were familiar and easy. For this challenge I did not run into anything I though was difficult. When I had problems in this challenge I simply researched solutions on MDN, for example I thought the strikethrough tag looked like this <strikethrough></strikethrough>, but after researching it I figured out that wasn't a tag.
